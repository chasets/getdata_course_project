Readme for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
===================================================

The code required to produce the tidy output that was submitted at the Coursera site is contained in a single R file in this repository: run_analysis.R. This file requies no other scripts to run. It is self-contained. 

A description of the data and the transformations used on that data can be found in the repository file called CodeBook.md.
